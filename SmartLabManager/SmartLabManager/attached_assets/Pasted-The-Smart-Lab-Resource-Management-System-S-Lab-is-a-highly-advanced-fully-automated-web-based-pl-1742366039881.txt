The Smart Lab Resource Management System (S-Lab) is a highly advanced, fully automated, web-based platform developed specifically for Soroti University to optimize laboratory resource allocation, equipment bookings, and scheduling while ensuring a secure, seamless, and interactive user experience. This system is built using Python (Flask) and Java (Spring Boot) for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and MySQL/PostgreSQL for database management, integrating cutting-edge features such as real-time updates, robust security mechanisms, AI-powered assistance, and QR code-based tracking. At the core of S-Lab is a role-based authentication system, ensuring controlled access for Lab Technicians (Admins), Lecturers, and Students, each with distinct functionalities and permissions. The user registration system requires essential details, including full name, gender (Male/Female/Other), department, faculty, student/staff ID, phone number, email, date of birth, and a profile picture upload, while a secure login mechanism employs JWT Authentication and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for enhanced security. Upon login, users are presented with an intuitive multi-page navigation system featuring a Home Page that displays lab activities, schedules, and a real-time notification system, while Lab Technicians gain access to a powerful Admin Dashboard, enabling them to add, update, and remove lab equipment, approve or reject lab bookings, and generate detailed analytical reports on resource usage and system activity. The Equipment Management Page categorizes lab resources under the School of Health Sciences, School of Engineering, and School of Business, ensuring a structured and accessible approach to equipment handling. The system's smart Booking Module allows students and lecturers to reserve lab equipment or schedule lab sessions, equipped with an Interactive Calendar supporting both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats, preventing double bookings and scheduling conflicts. Users also have a dedicated Profile Page where they can update personal information, upload profile pictures, and toggle between Dark Mode and Bright Mode for a customized experience. To foster engagement and feedback, a Comment Section enables students and lecturers to share insights and reviews on lab sessions and equipment usage, while the Usage Analytics Module presents equipment utilization statistics in percentage format, along with interactive charts and graphs for detailed insights into lab efficiency. A major highlight of the system is its QR Code-Based Check-In/Out System, which ensures secure tracking of lab equipment usage by scanning QR codes for verification. The Notifications System continuously updates users about booking approvals, rejections, upcoming sessions, and overdue equipment returns, ensuring timely communication. The Settings Page provides advanced security configurations, allowing users to activate Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), reset passwords, and customize the UI theme, while an easy logout option enhances session security. Additionally, an AI-powered Chatbot is integrated to assist users in booking equipment, navigating the platform, and answering lab-related queries, making the system more interactive and user-friendly. The Multi-Reporting Module empowers Lab Technicians to generate, view, and export reports on lab usage, pending bookings, and overall system activity, facilitating data-driven decision-making for improved resource allocation. Designed with modern UI/UX principles, S-Lab features a fully responsive interface, structured multi-page layout, and interactive elements, making navigation smooth and efficient. The system proudly incorporates Soroti Universityâ€™s official branding, including the Soroti University Badge, while a coffee-brown font color for headings enhances readability and maintains a professional aesthetic. The development roadmap follows a structured approach: backend implementation (Flask for authentication, Spring Boot for resource management), frontend development with React.js, database configuration (MySQL/PostgreSQL), API integration, security enhancements, AI implementation, testing, and final deployment on cloud-based servers (AWS/DigitalOcean) or university-hosted infrastructure. Key system optimizations include real-time WebSocket notifications, mobile-responsive design, offline mode for Lab Technicians, and advanced database indexing for high-performance queries. Security remains a top priority, with password hashing, token-based authentication, and access control mechanisms ensuring data protection. The expected outcome is a fully functional, highly secure, and efficient Smart Lab Management System that not only streamlines lab resource management but also introduces automation, accessibility, and innovation to the universityâ€™s academic infrastructure, making laboratory interactions smoother, more organized, and data-driven. By integrating advanced security, AI-powered assistance, QR code verification, and real-time analytics, S-Lab sets a new standard for smart university lab management, bringing forth a digital transformation in laboratory resource utilization at Soroti University. ðŸš€
