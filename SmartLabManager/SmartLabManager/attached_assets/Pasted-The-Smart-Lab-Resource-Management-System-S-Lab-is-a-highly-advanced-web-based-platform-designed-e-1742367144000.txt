The Smart Lab Resource Management System (S-Lab) is a highly advanced, web-based platform designed exclusively for Soroti University to efficiently manage laboratory resources, equipment bookings, and schedules while providing an engaging and seamless user experience. Featuring a powerful backend built with Java (Spring Boot) and Python, a dynamic React.js frontend, and MySQL/PostgreSQL for secure and optimized data handling, S-Lab ensures real-time updates, robust security, and a smooth user interface. At the core of the system is a role-based authentication system, allowing three main user roles—Lab Technicians (Admins), Lecturers, and Students—each with distinct permissions and functionalities. User registration requires detailed inputs, including full name, gender (Male/Female/Other), department, faculty, student/staff ID, phone number, email, date of birth, and a profile picture upload, while the secure login system supports Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for added security. Upon logging in, users can explore multiple structured pages, including a Home Page displaying lab activities, schedules, and a dynamic notification system, an Admin Dashboard where Lab Technicians can add, update, or remove lab equipment, approve or reject lab bookings, and generate analytical reports, and an Equipment Management Page that organizes resources under School of Health Sciences, School of Engineering, and School of Business for structured access. The powerful Booking System enables students and lecturers to reserve lab equipment or book lab sessions, with an Interactive Calendar supporting both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats to prevent scheduling conflicts. Each user has a dedicated Profile Page where they can update their details, upload a profile picture, and toggle between Dark Mode and Bright Mode for a personalized experience. The system also includes a Comment Section, allowing students and lecturers to provide feedback on lab sessions and equipment, and a real-time Usage Analytics Module, which visually represents equipment utilization in percentage, accompanied by interactive graphs and charts for better insights. The QR Code-based Check-In/Out system enhances security by tracking resource usage, while the Notifications System keeps users updated on booking approvals, rejections, upcoming sessions, and overdue equipment returns. The Settings Page provides key security features, including Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) activation, password reset, theme customization, and an easy logout option. For a streamlined experience, the AI-powered Chatbot assists users in booking equipment, navigating the system, and answering lab-related queries. A comprehensive multi-reporting module allows Lab Technicians to generate, view, and export reports on lab usage, pending bookings, and overall system activity, providing critical insights into lab efficiency. The system is branded with the official Soroti University badge Soroti University Badge to maintain an academic identity, and the bold headings with a coffee-brown font color enhance readability and accessibility. Additionally, the user-friendly, multi-page navigation system ensures smooth transitions between functionalities, making the platform highly intuitive and interactive. With a modern, highly responsive UI, fully structured multi-page layout, interactive elements, and a focus on usability, security, and efficiency, S-Lab is the ultimate smart lab management solution tailored exclusively for Soroti University, bringing automation, accessibility, and innovation into laboratory management." the code should be in one file and python should be used for backend together with java
